## Authentication ##

The API in [app](app/controllers) uses 3 keys of authentication:

 1. access_token: used when a user successfully logs in through the API. This parameter is required for all API requests, except API endpoints for login, sign up, reset password and installation.
 1. installation_key: Used when a device/installation has been registered to PicLib. This is required for login, sign up and reset password endpoints. Don't send this parameter if an access_token is available.
 1. api_key: This is used only for registering an installation. The API key is `fa8acaf23e85c71b5f261fb2016e2548`

### API Response ###

The API sends consistent response for success or errors.

For errors, it always sends `error` object with `code` for error code and `message` for error message.

Error example:

```
{
 "error":
 { 
     "code": 401,
     "message": "Error message"
 }
}
```

For successful API request, it always sends `data` object with either an `object` or an `array` with the requested data.

Succcess example:
```
{
 "data": []
}
```
